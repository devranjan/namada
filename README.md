## Overview

Namada serves as a Proof-of-Stake Layer 1 (L1) platform designed for interchain asset-agnostic privacy. Utilizing the CometBFT consensus, Namada empowers multi-asset shielded transfers for both native and non-native assets. The platform boasts comprehensive support for the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, along with a seamlessly integrated Ethereum bridge.

Namada operates on a contemporary proof-of-stake system featuring automatic reward compounding and cubic slashing. Additionally, it incorporates a stake-weighted governance signaling mechanism. Users engaged in shielded transfers receive rewards in native protocol tokens as acknowledgment for their contributions to the privacy set.

To enhance user interaction with the protocol, Namada offers a dedicated multi-asset shielded transfer wallet, ensuring a secure and private experience for users.
